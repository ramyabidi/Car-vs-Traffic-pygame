**Car vs Traffic** is a simple arcade-style game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to control your car and avoid collisions with incoming enemy cars on a two-lane road. The longer you survive without crashing, the higher your score will be!

## How to Play

1. **Controls**:
   - Use the **Left Arrow Key** to move your car to the left lane.
   - Use the **Right Arrow Key** to move your car to the right lane.

2. **Objective**:
   - Navigate your car between the lanes to avoid crashing into enemy cars.
   - Your score increases as long as you avoid collisions.

3. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends when your car collides with an enemy car.
   - A game over message will be displayed with your final score and the top 5 high scores.
   - If your score is among the top 5, it will be highlighted as a new high score.

4. **Difficulty Scaling**:
   - As you survive longer, the speed of the enemy cars gradually increases, making the game more challenging.
